## My Project

Creating a global network with AWS Transit Gateway Peering and CDK

[IN PROGRESS]

Pre-requisite: 
-	an AWS account
-	Installed and authenticated AWS CLI
-	Installed Python
-	Installed AWS CDK

Using your deviceâ€™s command line, check out the Git repository to a local directory on your device:
git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/aws-cdk-transit-gateway-peering.git
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-transit-gateway-peering.git

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:
python3 -m venv .env

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following step to activate your virtualenv.
source .env/bin/activate

pip install --upgrade aws-cdk.core
pip install aws_cdk.aws_ec2

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:
.env\Scripts\activate.bat

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.
pip install -r requirements.txt

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.
cdk synth
